## The SerialMonitor manages JSON encoded communications with the alamode
#
#  Currently bi-directional communications are limited to an initial message
#  to the alamode containing configration details followed by a series of
#  reads from the alamode containing sensor measurements and logs from the
#  alamode that terminates on when the fishtank_monitor is stopped.  All
#  communications are encoded in simple JSON strings.  Logs entries from the
#  alamode are prefixed to distinguish them from the fishtank_monitor logs
#  but are emitted to those logs also.  The SerialMonitor runs in its own
#  thread.

    ## Write a specified JSON object to the serial device
    #
    #  Although this class does not enforce this, it is nonetheless the case that
    #  writing to serial can only happen immediately upon startup, at which point
    #  the only communications supported are an endless series of reads from the
    #  alamode.
    #
    #  @todo  This class should ensure that the protocol (write first, then read
    #         forever) is enforced rather than leaving this responsibility to the
    #         client.

    #  sensor entries can appear together in a message.  Log entries are
    #  immediately send to the fishtank_monitor log with a prefix making them
    #  easily distinguishable.
