# Fishtank Monitor

I've kept fish for something like ten years and have come to realize that I mainly kill fish through PH crashes and, less frequently, through temperature swings.  I developed this project to help ensure I avoid creating these conditions in my tank.

Built on open-source foundations, the Alamode and Raspberry Pi based Fishtank Monitor provides the following features:
* Monitor PH level in the tank
* Monitor temperature level in the tank
* Show the current PH and temperature as well as the current time and IP address on the LCD display
* Email when conditions become unsafe
* Email reports showing recent sensor measurements (see below for an example)
* Control the tank lighting on a user-specified schedule
* Email when the PH sensor requires calibration

This project has benefitted greatly from the efforts of the developers of the projects on which it depends.  See [here](http://edwillis.github.io/FishtankMonitor/index.html) for a list of these projects.
