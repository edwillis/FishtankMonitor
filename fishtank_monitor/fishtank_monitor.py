## @package fishtank_monitor
#  The main function for the Fishtank Monitor
#
#  This module implements the main entry point for the Fishtank Monitor as well
#  as the principle exception handling strategy, which is to log, discard and
#  reconstruct affected objects and carry on.
# 
#  In addition, all database interaction (such as it is) is handled here.

#  @section Introduction Introduction
#  The decomposition of the software can be seen in each of the module pages.
#  Here, we'll cover the dynamic behavior of the system and how it is initialized
#  and does its work.  But first we'll cover the basic responsibilities of the main
#  hardware components in the system.
#
#  @section HW The Raspberry Pi and the Alamode
#  At the coarsest level, the system breaks down into the two main hardware
#  components:  the Raspberry Pi and the Alamode (Arduino-compatible) board.
#
#  @subsection Alamode The Alamode
#  The Alamode is responsible for:
#  * receiving configuration parameters from the Raspberry Pi and applying them
#  * periodically taking temperature and ph measurements
#  * updating the LCD display with time/measurements et al
#  * communicating measurement data and logs to the Raspberry Pi
#
#  @subsection PI The Raspberry Pi
#  The Raspberry Pi is responsible for:
#  * reading configuration parameters frm the config file and making them available
#    to the software components in the system.
#  * managing serial communications, including sending config parameters to the
#    Alamode and subsequently reading measurements data and logs from it
#  * controlling the tank lights on a user-defined schedule
#  * managing the various email notifications, including informational (accompanied
#    by charts) and warnings when tank conditions become unsafe
#  * storing sensor measurement data and some configuration parameters in the sqlite
#    database
#
#  @section Initialization Initialization and steady state operation
#  In rough detail, the dynamic behavior of the system is presented below.
#
#  @subsection Alamode The Alamode
#  * The Alamode starts up and configures some aspects of the hardware and then
#    blocks, waiting on JSON-formatted configuration data for the remainder of the
#    hardware ::setup
#  * The Alamode then enters a ::loop where it periodically:
#      * updates the LCD with the current time and sensor measurements in ::loop
#      * sends the Raspberry Pi JSON-formatted sensor measurements and logs
#      * receives the possibly updated configuration data and applies it
#
#  @subsection Pi The Raspberry Pi
#  * The Raspberry Pi reads the config file makes the configuration parameters available
#  * It creates the notifiers used to publish emailed reports and warnings
#    via ::notifications::get_notifiers
#  * It creates the ::serial_monitor::SerialMonitor and immediately uses it to send
#    the alamode configuration data
#  * It creates the ::scheduler::LightScheduler and starts it to manage the lights
#  * Thereafter, it enters a loop of writing measurement data to the sqlite database,
#    triggering the notifiers and detecting and recovering from certain errors

#  This software has benefitted from the work of many other open source developers and
#  would have been prohibitively difficult to produce without these other contributions.

#  I'd also like to express my thanks for the Raspberry Pi, Arduino and Python development
#  communities both in the high quality software they produce and for the wealth of
#  knowledge they share on the Internet.

## The main functional loop of ithe fishtank monitor.
#
#  This function arranges for the following:
#  * Set up serial monitoring
#  * Configure the parameters to use on the alamode
#  * Set up and start the light scheduler
#  And then enter the main loop where we:
#  * Read temperature and PH readings from the alamode
#  * Log the readings to our database
#  * Trigger the notifiers to send out warnings or informational messages
#  This function is also responsible for monitoring the health of the serial
#  monitor thread and restarting it on failures.
#
#  @param notifiers the list of notifier functors to call each iteration
